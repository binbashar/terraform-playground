# Maps and Lists

## Brief
This example showcases different operations that can be performed on maps and lists which could be useful if you need to iterate on them.
E.g. you could turn a complex map into a stripped-down version of it, or perhaps create a new map out of the combination of multiple maps in order to come up with an enrichened data structure that might be more suitable to your purposes.

## How to run
Initialize Terraform:
```
terraform init
```

Then plan (or apply):
```
terraform plan
```
